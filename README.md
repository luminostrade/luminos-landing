## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist**: Black background, warm ivory stars
- **Artsy**: Hand-drawn sketch aesthetic with subtle orbital rings
- **Professional**: Clean typography with generous spacing
- **Engaging**: Hidden comet easter eggs reward attention
- **Symbolic**: "Eye of Providence" theme - the center watches

## 🌠 Easter Egg

Watch carefully for ~20-30 seconds and you'll see random stars leave comet trails. This represents the AI "noticing" attentive viewers - a nod to the "Providence" intelligence behind Luminos.
